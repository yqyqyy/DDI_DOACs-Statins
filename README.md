# DDI of DOACs and Statins

Project title: Effect of concomitant use of statins and direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation

This study employed two complementary study designs to investigate possible drug-drug interaction effects between direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and statins. Leveraging Hong Kong territory-wide electronic health records, we utilised both cohort and within-person design to investigate the effect of bleeding, cardiovascular diseases and mortality associated with the concomitant use of DOACs and CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein-interacting statins (interacting statins) compared with DOACs and non-interacting statins in people with atrial fibrillation. 

All analyses were performed in Stata/MP 17.0 and R version 4.3.1.
